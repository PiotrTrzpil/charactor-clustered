# charactor-clustered
Clustered world of actors

Lets have an idea:

1. We have a rectangular 2D space with many entites running around.
2. The world space is supervised by multiple nodes, each responsible for one ovelapping chunk
3. The entity is transferred to a different node after leaving a space supervised by a current one
